- 👋 Hi, I’m @eimaster and I'm from Yemen 🇾🇪
- 👀 I’m interested in computers especially retro computers. I love MSX & SVI-328. I'm also interested in general computer programming especially in C++, Assembly Language, MSX-BASIC and making games, tools, and utilities with it, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ & x86 and Z80 Assembly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now.
- 📫 You can reach me on my email at eimaster13@gmail.com. I also have a Twitter & Facebook accounts but I don't remember them right now. I'll check them up ASAP and update my contact info here.
